How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

-Writing code that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable means keeping methods simple and not overly complete. The simpler a method is the easier it is to adapt to something else and the easier it is to maintain. By keeping the methods as general as possible it was much easier to call them in the dashboard as you don't have to worry as much about input and output being highly specific. I can use the CRUD module going forward to adapting it to together databases by simply changing a couple of things

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

-As a computer scientist I think it is best to first analyze the problem and determine the things it needs to work. Then analyze each of the things it needs to figure out what they need and keep doing that until you are down to things that cannot be broken up any further. I really and to do that with this class as it was extremely hard and complex at times and I needed to be able to break down the problems more than any other class

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

-Computer scientist solve problems. They get given a problem and they get told what the endpoint looks like. They need to be able to go in and determine the steps to get from point a to point b and execute them. They do the background work that everyone relies on to make things faster and more efficient. For example with Grazioso Salvare the software developed should vastly decrease the time it takes them to find trainable dogs and increases the amount of time they have to actually train due to the fact that they are not having to manually search through hundreds of entries, they can get a curated list and narrow down the options from there.
